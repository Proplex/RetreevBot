The following program is to be used with Kovan brick and an iCreate, using the default KISS firmware. It aims to be modular, and easily changed without mucking through functions.  

Most functions have not be commented, but will be done in time

##TODO:
- Align with less light sensors
- Create functions relating to rising and lowering fork lift
- Analyze objects in fork lift using camera and visual libraries
- Create checkpoints so that, in the event of a failure, the Retreev can continue without a total loss of points in the tournament.
